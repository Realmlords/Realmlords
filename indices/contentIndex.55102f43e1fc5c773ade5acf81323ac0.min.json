This is increased at later levels.\n\n**Channel Power:** Acting as a conduit for their god the cleric funnels some of their cosmic might into the realm of mortals. These are represented by channel dice which are spent to invoke powers. Clerics get bonus channel dice equal to their Wisdom modifier times their Divine Power rating. Any single effect may only use a number of dice equal to half their level (rounded down). Saves made against any invoked power are at DC 10 + dice spent + Cleric's Charisma modifier. These saves are affected by Magic Resistance, and also are modified (positive or negative) by the current Dominion.\n\nAt later levels the type of die used improves. The cost to invoke any power while within a sanctified temple to their god is reduced by 1 (minimum 1).\n\nFor example, a level 5 cleric may spend two dice for healing; restoring 2d6 hit points to their allies.\n\n**Healing:** As a standard action a cleric may invoke healing. This restores hit points equal to the total roll of channel dice spent to all believers within 30 ft. A cleric may also devote some of their power to curing other ailments, reducing the hit points healed by adding other effects.\n- Cure disease with save DC less than the total dice devoted to curing disease\n- Cure poisons with save DC less than the total dice devoted to curing poison\n- Restore ability damage to one ability score for every 3 channel dice spent restoring\n\nThis means a 6th level cleric could decide to cure all diseases with a save DC less than 3d6, or potentially heal 1d6 points of Constitution damage to their allies.\n\n**Breath of Life:** Even mortal wounds can be undone if a cleric acts fast enough, coming to the aid of the fallen before their soul leaves their body. By touching an individual the cleric restores hit points for each die channeled, similar to Healing. If this raises a creature's hit point total above the threshold required to kill them they are restored to life. A cleric only has 1 + Divine Power rounds to act after a creature has been slain for this to be effective.\n\n**Invoke Spell:** Trailing remnants of Vancian magic remain which the cleric can tap in to. By spending the appropriate amount of power dice the cleric can invoke the following. Note that this means the cleric must be of sufficient level (twice required amount) to invoke that many die on any single power.\n\nThe second time in a day the same spell is invoked its cost is unchanged, however every additional time invoking the same spell increases the cost by 1.\n\n| Cost | Spell |\n| ---- | ------ |\n| 1 | Augury |\n| 1 | Command |\n| 1 | Divine Favor |\n| 1 | Hide from Undead |\n| 1 | Protection from \\\u003cAlignment\\\u003e |\n| 1 | Sanctuary |\n| 1 | Shield of Faith |\n| 1 | Spiritual Weapon |\n| 2 | Blindness/Deafness |\n| 2 | Calm Emotions |\n| 2 | Enthrall |\n| 2 | Shield Other |\n| 2 | Remove Blindness/Deafness |\n| 3 | Death Ward |\n| 3 | Dimensional Anchor |\n| 3 | Speak with Dead |\n| 4 | Dismissal |\n| 4 | Freedom of Movement |\n| 4 | Repel Vermin |\n| 5 | True Seeing |\n\n**Curse the Unfaithful:** As a standard action the priest may curse a creature within 30 ft. From then on the priest may cause peril as they see fit. None of these requires an action, however each grants a save to end the effect. This save takes place after the effect has taken place however, simply preventing additional harm from befalling them. A creature which saves is immune to any curse from the same god for a day.\n- Spend channel dice to increase damage taken from any source by the amount rolled. Fortitude save ends\n- Spend 1 channel die to force a roll to be made twice, taking the worse result. Will save ends\n- Spend 1 channel die to decrease AC by the rolled amount for 1 round.

Will it fall into decay and ruin or will another god rise to power and found a new pantheon? You follow one such pretender god, a divine being of great potency and wisdom who seeks to claim the Thrones of Ascension and become the new Omnipotens.\n\nAs a [[DnDominions/Dominions Players/Being a Disciple|disciple]] you have a sliver of divine power, having received grand visions during the Age of Calamity which resulted in the pantokrator's death. In this new age you will need to spread the word of your pretender.\n\nWith your group decide\n- the name of your pretender god and their titles\n- one or more forms your god takes\n- allocate 4 points of scales\n- allocate 6 points of magic\n- spend 3 bonus points on either scales or domains\n- create their Blessing\n\n## Scales\nScales are opposing forces of the universe which your pretender seeks to rebalance in their image. Wherever your pretender spreads their dominion the laws of the universe shift towards their true nature. See [[DnDominions/Dominions Players/Dominion and Scales|Dominion and Scales]] for their exact effects.\n\nScales come in positive and negative sides, allocate between -3 to +3 to each scale, for a total of 4 points. The exception to this is Heat vs Cold, both of which cost points to increase. \n- Heat vs Cold - the turning of the seasons as summer opposes winter\n- Fortune vs Misfortune - how the Fates pluck the strings of mortals\n- Growth vs Death - vibrancy and life opposed by decay\n- Order vs Chaos - the oldest battle between Law and Chaos\n- Industry vs Sloth - innovation and drive against a stagnating cosmos\n\nFor example a pretender might have Cold (2), Misfortune (-1), Order (2), and Growth (1) for a total of 4 points spent.\n\n## Magic\nPretenders have secret knowledge concerning the operation of the universe, yet this knowledge is incomplete prior to their ascension. Allocate 6 points between the [[DnDominions/Dominions Players/Paths of Magic|Paths of Magic]] which determine the domains your pretender presides over. This determines special magic their priests have access to, grants you points for blessings, and makes accessing rituals of that domain easier for mages in their service. \n- A score of 2 or higher unlocks those paths during character creation for your disciple\n- 3 or higher allows a blessing to include powers from that path\n- 4 or higher gives priests special effects when Smiting or Banishing Undead\n\nThe paths are\n- Fire\n- Air\n- Water\n- Earth\n- Astral\n- Death\n- Nature\n- Blood\n\n## Bonus Points\nAdd 3 additional points, either as greater Scales or more Paths. \n\n## Blessings\nEach pretender has a unique blessing they grant to those that attain favor. As a [[DnDominions/Dominions Players/Being a Disciple|disciple]] you are automatically blessed when in your pretenders Dominion. Otherwise priests are able to grant these blessings temporarily to those deemed worthy (Sacred units only).\n\nEach point in a Path of Magic your pretender has gives you a corresponding point to spend on blessings, with a minimum score of 3 to have any blessings of that path. So a pretender with Fire 4, Nature 3, Astral 2 would pick four points of fire blessings and three points of nature blessings. Some blessings require points from multiple paths, as noted in their description.\n\n| Blessing | Cost | Effect |\n| ------ | ----- | ------- |\n| Superior Morale | Fire 1 | +1 Morale |\n| Wasteland Survival | Fire 1, Death 1 | Favored Terrain Wasteland |\n| Minor Fire Resistance | Fire 2 | Fire Resistance +5 |\n| Major Fire Resistance | Fire 3 | Fire Resistance +10 |\n| Attack Skill | Fire 3 | +2 bonus on all attack rolls |\n| Death Explosion | Fire 5 | |\n| Fire Shield | Fire 6 |  |\n| Flaming Weapons | Fire 6 | All attacks gain 2d6 fire damage |\n| Awe | Fire 7 | Awe +1 |\n\n\n| Blessing | Cost | Effect |\n| ------ | ----- | ------- |\n| Minor Shock Resistance | Air 1 | Electricity Resistance +5 |\n| Precision | Air 1 | +1 on all ranged attack rolls |\n| Swiftness | Air 2 | +2 on initiative and +1 dodge bonus to AC |\n| Major Shock Resistance | Air 3 | Electricity Resistance +10 |\n| Air Shield | Air 6 | Block 80% of mundane projectiles |\n| Thunder Weapons | Air 7 | |\n\n\n| Blessing | Cost | Effect |\n| ------ | ----- | ------- |\n| Minor Cold Resistance | Water 1 | Cold Resistance +5 |\n| Swamp Survival | Water 1, Nature 1 | Favored Terrain Swamp |\n| Water Walking | Water 2 | Can walk on water |\n| Major Cold Resistance | Water 3 | Cold Resistance +10 |\n| Defense Skill | Water 3 | +3 bonus to AC |\n| Frost Weapons | Water 4 | Attacks deal 2d4 cold damage |\n| Haste | Water 9 | +1 to hit, +1 dodge bonus to AC, gain extra attack as a free action once each round |\n\n\n| Blessing | Cost | Effect |\n| ------ | ----- | ------- |\n| Mountain Survival | Earth 1 | Favored Terrain Mountains |\n| Reinvigoration 1 | Earth 2 | Reinvigoration +1 |\n| Strength of the Earth | Earth 3 | Str +3 |\n| Unbreakable | Earth 4 | Heavy Fortification, +2 on saves vs disease and poison |\n| Fire and Shock Resistance | Earth 5 | Fire Resistance +10, Shock Resistance +10 |\n| Hard Skin | Earth 6 | +3 natural armor, DR 3/- | \n\n| Blessing | Cost | Effect |\n| ------ | ----- | ------- |\n| Minor Magic Resistance | Astral 1 | Magic Resistance +1 |\n| Spirit Sight | Astral 1, Death 1 | Spirit Sight |\n| Major Magic Resistance | Astral 3 | Magic Resistance +3 |\n| Solar Weapons | Astral 3, Fire 1 | Attacks deal +9 damage to undead and outsiders |\n| Magic Weapons | Astral 4 | All weapon attacks considered magical | \n| Far Caster | Astral 4 | Increase spell ranges by 50% |\n| Arcane Finesse | Astral 4 | +1 save DC on all spells |\n| Twist Fate | Astral 6 | Negate first attack each battle |\n\n| Blessing | Cost | Effect |\n| ------ | ----- | ------- |\n| Undying | Death 1 | Gain Diehard feat |\n| Withering Weapons | Death 4 | Critical hits deal 1 negative level |\n| Reanimator | Death 7 | Bring back dead foes #TODO |\n\n| Blessing | Cost | Effect |\n| ------ | ----- | ------- |\n| Resilient | Nature 1 | +1 HP per HD |\n| Low Light Vision | Nature 1 | Low Light Vision |\n| Minor Poison Resistance | Nature 1 | Poison Resistance +5 |\n| Major Poison Resistance | Nature 2 | Poison Resistance +10 |\n| Forest Survival | Nature 2 | Favored Terrain Forest |\n| Regeneration | Nature 7 | Fast Healing = Number of HD |\n\n| Blessing | Cost | Effect |\n| ------ | ----- | ------- |\n| Strong Vitae | Blood 1 | +1 HP per HD |\n| Strength of the Flesh | Blood 3 | +3 Str |\n| Blood Surge | Blood 4 | #TODO |\n| Blood Bond | Blood 5 | Shield other #TODO |\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T23:29:32.226827028Z","tags":[]},"/DnDominions/Dominions-Players/Divine-Power":{"title":"Divine Power","content":"## Levels of Divine Power\nDivine Power is similar to paths of magic in that increasing levels grant increased potency, along with access to additional effects.

Magic-users should select a school to specialize in and see what additional spells they have.\n\nGenerally you can expect that\n- your character knows spells based on their ratings in schools of magic\n- of those spells can cast the ones which they have enough power in the appropriate source\n- casting spells incurs fatigue, but is otherwise not restricted to specific slots\n- more potent spells cost gems to cast, although your [[#Arcane Reservoir]] allows for some number of 'free' spells each day\n\n# Schools and Sources\nEach spell is a unique expression of magical power defined by its *school* and *source* of power. The schools represent understanding of the methods of invoking arcane power. Each level of a school is called a *circle*, and is composed of all of the common spells of that school. No spell is known to be beyond the 7th circle. Natural Law has organized magic into these five schools:\n- Alteration - changing the nature of things\n- Conjuration - summoning creatures and invoking spirits\n- Evocation - projecting arcane power or commanding the universe\n- Enchantment - item crafting, warding, and some other magics\n- Thaumaturgy - scrying, manipulation of magic, curses\n\nThe sources of magical power are the fundamental forces which drive the supernatural that caster can draw on, and are composed of the elemental powers:\n- Fire\n- Water\n- Wind\n- Earth\n- Nature\n\nand the spiritual powers:\n- Astral\n- Blood\n- Death\n\nThe *potency* of a spellcaster is how powerful they are in a given source of magic. This increases the effect their spells have, and has some intrinsic benefits. Potency generally ranges between 1 and 9, although no mortal caster is likely to exceed 5 without the aid of enchanted tools or other spellcasters.\n\n## Casting A Spell\nTo cast a spell the spellcaster\n- must know the spell by having the minimum circle rank in that school, or access to a spellbook\n- have the minimum potency for the source of magic\n- spend time casting\n- pay the spell cost, reduced by their potency, and any corresponding gems\n- targets typically save against 10 + caster's Circle + source Potency \n\n\u003e [!spell] Fireball\n\u003e **School:** Evocation 3\n\u003e **Source:** Fire 2\n\u003e **Occlusion:** Common\n\u003e **Casting Time:** 1 action\n\u003e **Cost:** 10 fatigue, 1 fire gem\n\u003e **Range:** 30-\n\u003e The caster flings a searing ball of flame which explodes in a 4 pace radius area where it lands. This deals 6d6 damage + 6 x Fire potency fire damage, with a reflex save for half. \n\nThe fatigue cost of a spell is reduced for casters with high source potency. Going down to half for those with one greater than required, one third for two potency above the minimum, one fourth for having three above the requirement, and so on. Gem costs are not reduced, by can be paid from the [[#Arcane Reservoir]].\n\nFor example to hurl a *fireball* requires the caster have researched to at least the third circle of Evocation, and be at least a second potency fire mage. After casting for a single action an inaccurate spell attack is made with a range increment of 30 to see where the fireball lands. A third-circle evoker who is also a fourth-potency fire mage would force a save against DC 17, costing 4 fatigue.\n\n### Ranges\nSpell paces are usually listed in paces. Those with a minus sign after the range are \"inaccurate\" spells, which require a spell attack roll to land where intended. \n\nThere are also a number of special ranges\n- touch: requires a melee touch attack to deliver\n- gaze: maximum of 12 paces, and may be avoided by averting eyes\n\n### Reversed Spells\nMany spells have a reversed form, which has an opposite effect. Casters need not choose which version they are using until the moment of casting itself as they unleash the spell. Any spell may be reversed to negate other castings of the same spell, known as *[[#Countermagic|countering]]* a spell. \n\nSome notable reverse spells have gained their own names, *reduce person* being the reverse of *enlarge person*. Pedantic wizards will always refer to them as reversed versions of the true spell, insisting that upon shrinking you it was done via a *reversed enlarge person* spell.\n\n### Rituals\nRituals are grander magics which require at least an entire campaign turn to work, each is unique and detailed in their own section.\n\n# The Nature of Magic\n## Intrinsic Effects\nHaving access to a source of magical power aligns the caster's soul with the cosmos. This\n- grants a bonus equal to potency on all saves against schools from the same source\n- access to an [[#Arcane Reservoir]] to pay for spell costs each day\n\nAdditionally each source has a passive effect on the caster themselves based on their potency.\n\n| Source | Bonus |\n| ---- | ------- |\n| Fire | Fire resistance 3, +1 initiative |\n| Water | Cold resistance 3, hold breath for 1 additional minute |\n| Wind | Electricity resistance 3, +1 Perception |\n| Earth | Reduce damage from manufactured weapons by 1, +1 CMD |\n| Nature | Poison resistance +1, reduce damage from natural attacks by 1 |\n| Astral | None |\n| Blood | +1 HP per HD |\n| Death | -2 on Diplomacy |\n\n## Gems\nMany spells cost gems to cast as part of their cost, each associated with one of the sources of magic. In addition to this\n- One gem may be spent to increase effective potency by 1 for a source which a caster already has \n- A caster may not spend more gems on any single spell than their potency\n\nAlthough generically referred to as gems there is a high degree of variation in what may be used. Most widespread is that an Earth mage may use 100 gold pieces as a single Earth \"gem.\"\n\n### Arcane Reservoir\n- Access to temporary 'gems' equal to source potency\nEach dawn casters renew their arcane reservoir. This source of power allows them to cast some amount of spells without the need for gems, including the option to increase the potency of spells. Their potency in each of their sources is the total cap for this. Note that ritual magic cannot be aided by this; ritual spells require an actual expenditure.\n\n### Held Spells\nSpells with a duration of *held* are unique in that their effects are essentially permanent so long as the caster chooses to maintain them from their own reserves of magical power. Each of these has a cost which reduces the arcane reservoir of the caster using them, which is restored the following sunset after being released. This also means that a caster must have a sufficiently large reservoir to use these spells, both in terms of their total access to power and spells cast so far that day. \n\n## Occlusion\nSpells benefit from secrecy, with the most powerful being well-guarded mysteries. These are divided into three degrees of occlusion.\n- Universal: Minor spells which have become so fundamental that anyone with any degree of magical talent can discover them by trivial experimentation. These form the 0th circle of each school.\n- Common: Known to all spellcasters of a given aptitude in their school\n- Rare: Able to be researched as a specific effort by a spellcaster with appropriate mastery and school aptitude\n- Secret: Only able to be learned from a particular text or spellcaster willing to share the secret knowledge\n\nOcclusion does not imply a lack of reputation however, only the degree to which the secrets of actually casting the spell are a mystery. Only a dread few known how to cast the legendary *touch of death*, yet all who deem themselves wise fear it.\n\n## True Illusions\nA distinction is to be made between an *illusion* and the sort of mirage which an Air mage can create. Notably while many Air spells can be used to deceive by creating the appearances of objects which are not truly there, what they are making is still very much real; it is simply that the real phenomenon being produced is useful artistry for the purpose of misdirection.\n\n*Illusions* on the other hand are an ontological paradox. A conjured illusion is capable of essentially all outward manifestations of a real example of its kind. They can deal damage, interact with observers, produce sight and smell, even touch. The illusory duck would look like a duck, swim like a duck, quack like a duck, yet not *be* a duck. This lack of metaphysical solidity is what permits them to be destroyed by disbelief.\n\n## Countermagic\n#TODO ","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T23:29:32.27482742Z","tags":[]},"/War-Of-The-Immortals/Magic/Spell-Ideas":{"title":"Spell Ideas","content":"Mark\n\nRecall\n\nSpirit Sight","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T23:29:32.27482742Z","tags":[]},"/War-Of-The-Immortals/Magic/Thaumaturgy":{"title":"Thaumaturgy","content":"The thaumaturgy is a difficult to pin down worker of the arcane arts. Although many wizards acquire some knowledge of thaumaturgy as a way to collaborate with their fellow or divine secrets of the universe, its true extent can be opaque to many.\n\nThis school involves many spells which provide direct knowledge, interact with the correspondences between planes, and lay potent curses.\n\n# Nature of Thaumaturgy\n## Detection Spells\nSpells of detection, such as *detect invisibility* instantaneously reveal if there is or is not something of that nature within their area. When cast the mage may choose one of the following modes:\n- Everything within a 5 pace radius, including the caster\n- A cone formed by their outstretched arms, 10 paces long and a maximum of 180 degrees wide\n- One particular object, creature, or room which they touch\n\nNote that this does not give any particular information on the exact location or nature of what is detected, although repeated castings of the spell may allow for a structured process of elimination and triangulation. Additionally these spells, like many others, are thwarted by magic resistance and interposed barriers of lead or gold.\n\nLastly a caster may choose to enact any spell of detection as a [[War Of The Immortals/Magic/Magic and Spellcasting#Held Spells|held spell]]. For as long as the spell remains they are continually informed of either the presence of absence of the detected target within a 5 pace radius. Some spells, such as *detect magic* aren't very informative; most mages are always within 5 paces of some magic. But instantly knowing of the approach of anything invisible can be quite useful.\n\n## Curses\nCurses are malefic effects typically placed upon an object, area, or person. Although each is terrifying and unique there are a number of common features. Notably that they may be ended at any time by the original caster renouncing them.\n\nNote that there generally is no save to avoid being cursed, however there are saves to avert the effects of a curse. Magic resistance however is able to provide protection against the initial onset of a curse.\n\n# Circles\n## The First Circle of Thaumaturgy\n\n## The Second Circle of Thaumaturgy","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T23:29:32.27482742Z","tags":[]},"/War-Of-The-Immortals/Magic/Universal-Magic":{"title":"Universal Magic","content":"Universal spells are the 0th level Circles of each of the schools of magic, and available to all spellcasters, although they still require access to the appropriate sources of arcane potency to actually cast them.\n\n## Alteration\n\n## Conjuration\n\n## Evocation\n\n## Enchantment\n\n## Thaumaturgy\n\u003e [!spell] Channeling\n\u003e **School:** Thaumaturgy\n\u003e **Source:** (Varies) 1\n\u003e **Occlusion:** Common\n\u003e **Casting Time:** Special\n\u003e **Cost:** 20\n\u003e **Range:** self\n\u003e There exists a version of this spell for each source of power.

As soon as even a drop of venom touches someone they embark on a journey which few return from.\n\nWhen a character is poisoned they must save vs poison each round or suffer increasingly dire effects based on the specifics of the poison in question, until they have made a total number of saves equal to the number of doses they have been afflicted with. In general successful saves do not prevent a character from being poisoned, or put an end to the effects, but rather avoid the situation becoming worse. Note also that this means there is no initial save when first being exposed, saves begin the following round.\n\n- The potency of a source determines how many doses a character begins with in their system\n- Each round, make a save vs poison and decreases the number of doses in their system by 1, unless they roll a natural 1 on the save\n\t- Natural 20 on save removes an additional dose\n- On a failed save, experience the next effect on the poison track\n\t- The first effect after the first failed save, the second after the second failed save, and so on. Characters at the end of the track continue to experience the terminal effect on each failed save.\n- Character is no longer poisoned when doses reaches 0\n- Additional applications of poison increase the number of doses a character has\n\t- Source may not increase doses above double its potency, instead additional doses increase save DC by 2 for each excess dose on the next save\n\nSome poisons deal \"poison damage,\" this is otherwise identical to regular hit point damage, except it is reduced by poison resistance. \n\n### The Bite of the Hypnalis\nAs an example consider the hypnalis. When it strikes a single bite is able to apply three doses of venom to a potential victim.\n\n\u003e [!poison] Hypnalis Venom\n\u003e **Save DC:** 18\n\u003e **Poison Track**\n\u003e - Numbness spreads through the body, dealing 1d4 Dexterity damage and 1 damage to all mental ability scores\n\u003e - Drowsiness begins, causing the victim to be staggered for the duration of their poisoning and one minute after. Deals 1d4 damage to all mental ability scores\n\u003e - *Eternal Slumber:* The venom lulls its subject into an eternal sleep. Although they still age they need not eat or drink, and no force is able to rouse them short of a cure to the venom itself.\n\nSomeone bit by the hypnalis will have to make a save the following round. Failing the first would result in 1d4 Dexterity damage and the damage to all ability scores. If they make their save on the second round no additional ill effects would occur, but would still be required to make the third save, as three doses of poison require a total of three saves. \n\nIf they retreat now a hypnalis would be unlikely to follow, with a failure on the final save resulting in a drowsiness that lingers for some time, and ability score damage. However if they press their luck and are bit again they would receive another 3 doses. While possible to succeed on those additional saves if they fail a total of three (or more, although that isn't relevant for this venom) saves then they would sleep eternally. Fortunately a person is too large for a hypnalis to eat, maybe in some decades another will stumble across their body and discover a way to rouse them.\n\n### Known Poisons\nInnumerable noxious substances lurk in the world, below are some of those that are either widespread enough to be common knowledge; or so feared as to be legendary. \n\n\u003e [!poison] River Nautilus Spines\n\u003e **Save DC:** 14\n\u003e **Poison Track**\n\u003e - 1 point of Strength damage as muscle spasms begin to spread\n\u003e - A terrifying thirst overwhelms the victim, along with 1 point of Strength damage. Victims loose all reason in a quest to satiate their thirst in any way possible; leaping into the river being most preferable. Resisting this requires a DC 10 Will save, with the DC increasing by 2 for each additional time this is inflicted upon them. The thirst persists while the victim is poisoned and for 4 rounds after.\n\n\u003e [!poison] Scythicon\n\u003e A slow and terrifying toxin concocted to cause pain and lingering death. Rather than saving every round those affected by Scythicon must save every minute. Additionally the cap of doses inflicted by any one source is quadruple its potency, rather than double, meaning that a large number of doses may be accumulated. The potency of a Scythicon arrow is typically the result of the damage die.\n\u003e **Save DC:** 18\n\u003e **Poison Track**\n\u003e - The many components of Scythicon work to unmake the body in innumerable ways. Each failed save deals 1d4 points of damage to a random ability score and causes terrifying pain. This deals 1 poison damage and imposes a -2 on all checks for the next minute.\n\n\u003e [!poison] Red Lotus\n\u003e Unlike most poisons a single \"dose\" of red lotus powder must be administered as a regular part of diet over the course of a week. A save is made at the end of the week, unless the red lotus extract is neutralized by salt, and these effects are only cumulative if the character's diet continues to contain red lotus (unless a natural 1 is rolled on a save, which then requires an additional save even beyond the period that exposure stops as normal). \n\u003e **Save DC:** 14\n\u003e **Poison Track**\n\u003e - Dreams become exceptionally vivid and a feeling of mental clarity pervades\n\u003e - The dreams continue and the character experiences regular periods of hyperfocus, improving efficiency at many tasks but also interfering with their ability to have a sense of time and occasionally disrupting the order memories form. This provides a +2 bonus to Memory based checks, but a -2 to their Aura score.\n\u003e - At this point ingesting red lotus becomes as necessary for life as food or drink. This manifests not as an addiction but more as an additional biological drive. Those unable to access red lotus begin to starve.","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T23:29:32.27482742Z","tags":[]},"/War-Of-The-Immortals/Skills":{"title":"Skills","content":"Class skills","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T23:29:32.27482742Z","tags":[]},"/War-Of-The-Immortals/Time-and-Downtime":{"title":"Time and Downtime","content":"The passage and tracking of time is an important aspect of every character's journey.
