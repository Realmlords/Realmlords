Now this book of terrible secrets roams through time, distributing unwholesome wisdom to those who find it.\n- shimmering rainbow light struggling to emerge from within the pages\n- cackling demon face adorning each cover\n- iron-bound lock waiting for the touch of blood\n\n#### Powers\n*Travel Through Time and Space* - the Tome is able to fling itself, largely at random, across the realms and into the future. Despite having no direct control a malign twist of fate tends to end it up in a secluded location, where it waits for someone unwise to open it.\n\n*Oath of Blood* - opening the Tome requires a sacrifice of blood to unseal the lock which binds it, something which is pictorially made clear along the binding. The first drop loosens the lock and grants the ability to read the tome, something which may be of interest to those questing for a greater [[Magic/Spells/Innate/Truespeech]]. To fully open the tome another drop must be shed and an oath read out from the cover. \"To use this knowledge for personal gain, to share with none, and cackle at life's vicissitudes.\" \n\n*Marginal Intelligence* - Elek-Nor severed a portion of his soul to reside in his Tome, which grants it a limited understanding and capacity to fulfill its creator's wishes in the ages since his death.\n\nOther than this the tome has little supernatural power, its main effect being the knowledge contained within. An astute reader will learn of the following\n- the true names of a number of powerful (and vindictive) creatures of Law and Chaos\n- spells for *[[Magic/Spells/Conjure Cackling Demons|Conjuring Cackling Demons]]*, the *[[Magic/Spells/Pursuing Boil]]*, and the insidious *[[Magic/Spells/Subtle Caltrop]]*\n- a lengthy treatise on creating illusions\n- a bizarrely exhaustive list of ideas for inciting strife, seeking revenge, and constructing pranks for a wide range of subjects and situations\n\n\n\u003e [!info] Destroying the Tome\n\u003e \n\u003e Any attempt to destroy the Tome through normal means would result in it flinging itself across time and space once again. However, if simply sending it far from the dominions that it is currently plaguing is not enough, one would have to find a way to bind it beforehand to prevent such flight. Such an effort would need to be exceptionally subtle, and succeed on the first try, lest the tome escape between the realms.

You follow one such pretender god, a divine being of great power and wisdom who seeks to claim the Thrones of Ascension and become the new Omnipotens.\n\nAs a [[DnDominions/Dominions Players/Being a Disciple|disciple]] you are a chosen among your people, having received grand visions during the Age of Calamity which resulted in the pantokrator's death. In this new age you will need to spread the word of your pretender.\n\nWith your group decide\n- the name of your pretender god and their titles\n- one or more forms your god takes\n- allocate 4 points of scales\n- allocate 6 points of magic for their domains\n- spend 3 bonus points on either scales or domains\n- create their Blessing\n\n## Scales\nScales are opposing forces of the universe which your pretender seeks to rebalance in their image. Wherever your pretender spreads their dominion the laws of the universe shift towards their true nature. See [[DnDominions/Dominions Players/Dominion and Scales|Dominion and Scales]] for their exact effects.\n\nScales come in positive and negative sides, allocate between -3 to +3 to each scale, for a total of 4 points. The exception to this is Heat vs Cold, both of which cost points to increase. \n- Heat vs Cold - the turning of the seasons as summer opposes winter\n- Fortune vs Misfortune - how the Fates pluck the strings of mortals\n- Growth vs Death - vibrancy and life opposed by decay\n- Order vs Chaos - the oldest battle between Law and Chaos\n- Industry vs Sloth - innovation and drive against a stagnating cosmos\n\nFor example a pretender might have Cold (2), Misfortune (-1), Order (2), and Growth (1) for a total of 4 points spent.\n\n## Domains\nPretenders have secret knowledge concerning the operation of the universe, yet this knowledge is incomplete prior to their ascension. Allocate 6 points between the [[DnDominions/Dominions Players/Paths of Magic|Paths of Magic]] which determine the domains your pretender presides over. This determines special magic their priests have access to, grants you points for blessings, and makes accessing rituals of that domain easier for mages in their service.\n\nThe paths are\n- Fire\n- Air\n- Water\n- Earth\n- Astral\n- Death\n- Nature\n- Blood\n\n## Bonus Points\nAdd 3 additional points, either as greater Scales or more Domains. \n\n## Blessings\nEach pretender has a unique blessing they grant to those that attain favor. As a [[DnDominions/Dominions Players/Being a Disciple|disciple]] you are automatically blessed when in your pretenders Dominion. Otherwise priests are able to grant these blessings temporarily to those deemed worthy.\n\nEach point in a Path of Magic your pretender has gives you a corresponding point to spend on blessings. So a pretender with Fire 4, Nature 3 would pick four points of fire blessings and three points of nature blessings.
